The AI works by generating lists of all possible moves, and uses this to form a tree of game states.
At the bottom level of the tree, the AI uses a board evaluator function to assign a score to each board based on how good the position is.
Next, the AI makes assigns values to the remaining nodes of the tree by assuming that each player will choose the best move it can.
Finally, the AI picks the node that with the best score, and makes that move.
This approach is called minimax, because the algorithm minimizes the best move your opponent can make.
Minimax is very effective for games like chess, since on average there are only 35 moves you could make each turn.
Minimax is more challenging for Abalone, because there are around 70 moves you can make per turn.
To speed up the algorithm, an optimization called Alpha-Beta Prunning is used.
Alpha-Beta Prunning stops searching branches of the game tree if it becomes clear that this state will never be reached.
